================================================
fd.partialdate - library for partial date values
================================================

**fd.partialdate** is a library for representing and serializing
possibly partial dates, where missing portions may be omitted at the
least-significant bits, only.  (For example, a date might include just
the year, or the year and month, but will never be missing the month but
not the day.)

Serialization only supports the most common YYYY[-MM[-DD]] format from
ISO 8601.
