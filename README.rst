================================================
fd.partialdate - library for partial date values
================================================

**fd.partialdate** is a library for representing and serializing
possibly partial dates, where missing portions may be omitted at either
the least-significant or most-significant bits.  (For example, a date
might include just the year, the year and month, or the month and day,
but will never be missing the month but not the day.)

Serialization only supports the expanded format from ISO 8601.
